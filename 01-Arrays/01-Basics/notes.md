# Array Basics (Quick Reference)

## Things I must remember

-   vector is dynamic, array is static
-   Always pass vector by reference if not copying
-   Prefer range-based for loops
-   Index carefully (0-based)

## Common mistakes

-   Off-by-one errors
-   Forgetting to clear vector between test cases
-   Using arr.size() (not valid for raw arrays)

## STL helpers

-   sort
-   reverse
-   min_element / max_element
-   binary_search
